Mapper
In the mapper we read the given field using the "re" library to find the view
count of the post in given row and row index of the given row.
We print the viewcount and rowindex in a list format for our simplicity.
Here key is viewcount and value is rowindex.We can use that in either way also
because we can extract data similarly in a reducer.

Reducer
In the reducer we first capture the first 10 outputs of mapper and keep the 
size of list fixed to 10.Whenever new element enters we check if a smaller element
than the current element:-
i)if the element is present we replace it with the minimum element and update the 
list.
ii)if not found the list remains unchanged.

We fixed the length 10 because if there is large amount of input the list may
overflow.
Time:-We calculated top 10 using both the methods i.e. list of fixed 10 elements
and with all elements and observed that "10 element list took less time than other."

Wrapper:-
We can directly run the wrapper to get the output and time required in calculation.

Result:-We finally printed the top 10 views result.

Mapper:-
In this we are outputting the hour as a key and 1 as its value.Hour is find here
using regular expression library in python.
And the we print the key value pair in the list form for our simplicity.

Reducer:-
We are taking input as line and converting into line using eval function.
As the hours are already in sorted order,we have got the output just by comparing
current hour with previous and just increasing the count by 1 and printing 
hour,count if the hour changes.
We have appended the hours to list because we know hours can't be very large 
that it may lead to overflow so sorted directly and printed the peak count to
least count.
We have not considered the hours with no comments.

Wrapper:-
We can directly run the wrapper to get the output and time required in calculation.

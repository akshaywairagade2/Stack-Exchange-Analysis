Yes there is an oppurtunity of cloud deployement.
The things they will save is the most important data as at cloud storage,data 
is at a reduced risk of system failure since all data is stored and backed-up 
on an external devise.Cloud providers automate the backup process for us.

We can save cost as cloud storage eliminates the need to pay for software 
licences and updates since all this is included in one global monthly price.
The need to pay dedicated storage professional in-house is also deducted.
Here we pay only for the amount of storage we need so that cost is also reduced.

Our data is secure also as professional cloud storage firms typically offer far 
better data security than is otherwise available to us.

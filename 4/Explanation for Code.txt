Mapper:-
We are getting the month and the comment by using the regular expression library
in python.Our key is month and value is the length of median which we find using 
len() function in python.
We converted it in list format and added the year in last for our simplicity.

Reducer:-
As the months are all in sorted order we store the lengths of comment in list.
As the month changes we sort the list find the median and print it in given format.
Proper implication can be found in code.

Wrapper:-
We can directly run the wrapper to get the output and time required in calculation.

In final result we get the median of comment's length of each month.
